# React Router v4 continued 🕐

- Docs: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api
- Top level import
  import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

- Wrap our entire App.js in the <BrowserRouter>
- Lets look at what BrowserRouter now gives us access to in props of Landing

# Routes 🏃‍🏃‍

- Create our Routes by looking at previous views
- <Route exact path="/path" component={ComponentWeWant} />
- <Route render={props => (<Checkout {...props} pay={this.pay} )}/>

# Link 🗡

- Instead of using <a> tags we'll use Link from React Router
- Replace the 5 Nav links and the 1 button link in cart
